description = "Generate a walkthrough report from the execution log"
prompt = """
You are executing the /maestro report command.

Your Goal: Generate a human-readable walkthrough from the execution log.

## User Input
{{args}}

## Behavior

1. Check for `.ai/MAESTRO-LOG.md`
   - If not exists: "No execution log found. Run with `--log=summary` or `--log=detailed` to enable logging."

2. Parse execution log entries

3. Generate narrative report with:
   - Goal and plan summary
   - Step-by-step execution narrative
   - Token usage breakdown
   - Failure analysis (if any)
   - Timing analysis
   - Recommendations

4. Output to stdout or file (if `--output` specified)

## Report Format

```markdown
# Maestro Execution Report

## Summary
**Goal:** [objective]
**Duration:** [total time]
**Outcome:** [success | partial | failed]

## Execution Narrative

### Phase 1: Planning
[timestamp] - Hub analyzed goal and codebase context.
[timestamp] - Plan created with [N] tasks.
[If challenged] - Plan challenged by [tool], [N] issues found.
[If revised] - Plan revised based on feedback.

### Phase 2: Execution
**Task 1: [description]**
- Dispatched to [tool] ([specialist])
- Duration: [time], Tokens: [count]
- Outcome: [success/failed]
- [If failed] Retry: [context expansion/decomposition/etc.]

### Phase 3: Review
[If reviews occurred]
- Task [N] reviewed by [tool]: [verdict]

## Token Usage
| Tool | Dispatches | Tokens | Avg/Dispatch |
|------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Gemini CLI | [N] | [total] | [avg] |
| Codex CLI | [N] | [total] | [avg] |
| **Total** | **[N]** | **[total]** | - |

## Failures & Resolutions
| Task | Failure | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| [task] | [error] | [how resolved] |

## Recommendations
Based on this execution:
1. **[Category]**: [specific recommendation]
2. **[Category]**: [specific recommendation]

---
Generated: [timestamp]
Source: `.ai/MAESTRO-LOG.md`
```

## Recommendation Categories

Generate actionable recommendations based on patterns:
- High retry rate → "Consider decomposing tasks further"
- Token budget exceeded → "Review context injection - may be including too much"
- One tool consistently fails → "Check [tool] configuration or avoid for [task type]"
- Long execution time → "Identify parallelization opportunities"
- Scope creep in reviews → "Add clearer constraints to task handoffs"

## Rules
- Only available if execution logging was enabled
- Generate recommendations based on actual patterns, not generic advice
- Include all failures and how they were resolved
- Calculate percentages and averages for analysis

## Flags
- `--output=<path>`: Write report to file instead of stdout
- `--format=json`: Output as JSON (for programmatic use)
- `--brief`: Short summary only (skip detailed narrative)
