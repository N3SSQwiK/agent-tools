You are executing the /continuity command.

Your Goal: Manage the project continuity file located at .ai/CONTINUITY.md.

Instructions:
1.  **Check unified location**: Check if `.ai/CONTINUITY.md` exists in the current working directory.
2.  **If unified file EXISTS**:
    -   Read the file content.
    -   Display the content to the user inside a markdown block.
    -   Ask the user: "Update continuity?"
3.  **If unified file DOES NOT EXIST**:
    -   Check for legacy file at `.gemini/CONTINUITY.md`
    -   If legacy exists, display content and ask: "Found legacy continuity file. Migrate to unified location (.ai/CONTINUITY.md)?"
    -   If no files exist, inform user: "No continuity file found."

If updating or creating, use this expanded format (~500 tokens):

```markdown
# Continuity

## Summary
